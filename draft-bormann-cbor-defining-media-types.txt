1.  Introduction

   CBOR [RFC8949] is a representation format that can be used as a basis
   for defining data formats for interchange.  Internet Media Types
   [RFC6838] allow to give names to such formats and register them with
   IANA, these names are then directly useful in protocols such as HTTP
   and E-Mail.  Content-Formats (Sections 5.10.3, 5.10.4, and 12.3 of
   [RFC7252]) provide a way to assign small numbers to combinations of
   media-types, their parameters, and content-codings Section 8.5 of
   [RFC7230], employing the Content-Formats subregistry of the CoRE
   Parameters registry [IANA.core-parameters].

1.1.  Terminology

   Although this document is not an IETF Standards Track publication, it
   adopts the conventions for normative language to provide clarity of
   instructions to the implementer.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

2.  Using CBOR

   In many cases, the interchange format and thus media type to be
   defined will be a single CBOR data item: See Section 2.1 for details.
   In some cases, a CBOR sequence [RFC8742] will be employed instead,
   which calls for a slightly different kind of registration: See
   Section 2.2 for details.

2.1.  The +cbor structured syntax suffix for CBOR data items

   Section 9.5 of [RFC8949] registers a "structured syntax suffix" of
   "+cbor" for media types based on a single encoded CBOR data item.

   The idea of a structured syntax suffix is that processors that do not
   know the specific semantics of a cbor-based media type can still
   process its syntactical structure once they recognize that the media
   type name ends in "+cbor".  While the usefulness of that often does
   not extend beyond diagnostics and debugging, this is still a valid
   motivation.  Also, some generic processing schemes such as
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed] may be directly applicable to all "+cbor"-
   suffixed media types.

   For example, SenML, in Section 6 of [RFC8428], defines a media type
   "application/senml+cbor", among its related media types such as
   "application/senml+json".

2.2.  The +cbor-seq structured syntax suffix for CBOR sequences

   Section 3 of [RFC8742] says:

   |  [...] the "+cbor-seq" structured syntax suffix [...] SHOULD be
   |  used by a media type when the result of parsing the bytes of the
   |  media type object as a CBOR Sequence is meaningful and is at least
   |  sometimes not just a single CBOR data item.  (Without the
   |  qualification at the end, this sentence this sentence is trivially
   |  true for any +cbor media type, which of course should continue to
   |  use the "+cbor" structured syntax suffix.)

   "application/missing-blocks+cbor-seq", as registered in Section 12.2
   of [I-D.ietf-core-new-block], is an example.

2.3.  Getting the media type registration

   The media type registration template defined in [RFC6838] is full of
   historic arcana that is not often fully explained in that RFC.
   Appendix A defines a hypothetical media type application/foo+cbor.

   A few aspects warrant further discussion:

   *  The _Encoding considerations_ are often used in a way that is
      different from the intention in Section 4.8 of [RFC6838], which is
      a simple selection between "binary" and various alternatives that
      are now all obsolete.

   *  At the time of writing this, the _Fragment identifier
      considerations_ are mostly irrelevant for CBOR; just in case we do
      come up with a fragment identifier syntax (based on
      [I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base]?), the boilerplate given in Appendix A
      can be used.

   *  The _Intended Usage_ is always COMMON, except for OBSOLETE or
      LIMITED USE specifications.  The latter case can probably best be
      elaborated as "call us before you use this".  A _Restrictions on
      usage_ field is provided to possibly reduce the number of phone
      calls in this case; otherwise that field is "N/A".

   *  [RFC6838] has fields _Author_ and _Change Controller_. For IETF
      documents, the latter is always the IETF, as represented by the
      IESG (but see Appendix A).

2.4.  Getting a Content-Format number registration

   As per Section 12.3 of [RFC7252], a content format number
   registration requires an existing media-type registration, which you
   therefore need to do first (or at least in parallel).  A Content-
   Format registration needs two additional pieces of information:

   *  Is there a content-coding (erroneously called "Encoding" in
      Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]) to be applied?  This is usually the
      identity content-coding (usually registered as "-"), or it can be
      a compression scheme such as "deflate" [RFC1951], "br" (brotli,
      [RFC7932]), etc.  For CBOR data items, traditional data
      compression does not often make a lot of sense (but it might, for
      large data items).  An example for a content-format in the
      Content-Formats subregistry of the CoRE Parameters registry
      [IANA.core-parameters] that does have a non-identity content-
      coding is 11060, which is "application/cbor" with "deflate"
      content-coding.

   *  Which number range should the registration go into?  Section 12.3
      of [RFC7252] provides four ranges

3.  Using COSE

   COSE (RFC in [RFC8152], soon to be supplanted by
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct], [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs],
   with [I-D.ietf-cose-hash-algs]) provides cryptographic building
   blocks that can be used in CBOR formats.  It is generally RECOMMENDED
   to use these instead of home-brew crypto constructions whenever they
   are applicable.  Support for libraries is one reason, but also the
   availability of crypto agility [BCP201] through the use of the COSE
   registries [IANA.cose].

   ...

   Note that COSE defines media types and content formats already.
   These are generic formats that do not say anything further about the
   syntax and the semantics of the CBOR data that may be contained in
   the COSE constructs.

4.  Using CDDL

   Many text-based protocols used in the IETF use ABNF [RFC5234] to
   provide formal, machine-readable definitions for their syntax.  The
   Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL, [RFC8610]) fulfills the
   analogous function for CBOR (as well as for JSON [RFC8259]).  A
   specification that defines a CBOR (or JSON) based media type SHOULD
   provide a CDDL specification, which is often _very_ short (compare
   Figure 1 of [RFC8710], as reproduced below).

   multipart-core = [* multipart-part]
   multipart-part = (type: uint .size 2, part: bytes / null)

      Figure 1: Example CDDL specification as per Figure 1 of RFC 8710

   See Appendix F of [RFC8610] for a tool that can be used in
   validating, as well as checking for the correct meaning, a CDDL
   snippet like the above.

Appendix A.  Example "application/foo+cbor" registration

   This appendix contains an example registration template for a
   hypothetical "application/foo+cbor" media type (fashioned after that
   in [RFC8710]), in a form that can be pasted into a kramdown-rfc
   source file.

   Note that the contact information and the change controller
   information is not very well defined; this may get some comments
   during media type registration review and IETF last call.  It may
   seem obvious to include the WG name in the contact information, but
   that is likely to shut down before the specification becomes
   irrelevant.  Recent RFCs are confused whether the change controller
   should be simply "IETF" or simply "IESG", or "IESG" plus the iesg
   mail address iesg@ietf.org (mailto:iesg@ietf.org).  [RFC9000] is an
   interesting counter-example, as it seems to assume a perpetual WG:

   |  All registrations in this document are assigned a permanent status
   |  and list a change controller of the IETF and a contact of the QUIC
   |  Working Group (quic@ietf.org).

   [RFC8949] probably has the most useful solution for the contact
   information, assuming that the area ART (or at least its mail
   address) will be around for a while:

   |  Contact:  IETF CBOR Working Group (cbor@ietf.org) or IETF
   |     Applications and Real-Time Area (art@ietf.org)
